## Abstract: 
> **Background** 

> Although closed-note exams have traditionally been used to evaluate students in undergraduate biology classes, open-note exams are becoming increasingly common, though little is known about how students prepare for these types of exams. We investigated student preparation habits for open-note versus closed-note exams. Specifically, we investigated the following two research questions: (1a) How do students perceive open-note exams impact their exam scores, anxiety, the amount they studied, and the amount their peers studied? (1b) How do these perceptions relate to performance outcomes?  (2a) How do students prepare for open-note exams compared to previous experiences with closed-note exams? (2b) How do these preparation methods relate to performance outcomes? 

> **Results** 

> Results demonstrate students perceived increased exam scores, decreased exam-anxiety, decreased study time spent personally and decreased study time spent by their peers for open-note exams as compared to past experiences with closed-note exams. Open-ended survey responses analyzed through first- and second-cycle analyses showed many students adapted their study habits by focusing on note preparation and broad conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization. Using linear mixed effects models to assess student performance, we found students who focused on note preparation and utilized outside resources outperformed students who did not report those study habits. 

> **Conclusions** 

> As institutions shift towards flexible and scalable assessments that can be used in face-to-face or online environments, open-note exams are becoming increasingly common. While previous research has investigated whether open-note exams are comparable to closed-note exams in terms of student performance, none have focused on the differences in how students prepare for open-note exams. We conclude that, with intentional guidance from the instructor, open-note exams have the potential to promote effective study habits and reward higher-order thinking. Our results highlight how studies into student preparation for exams are an important part of understanding student performance.
